👋 Hi there, I'm Hao - the Full-Stack Software Engineer! 💻

👨‍💻 As a passionate about coding especially Javascript stuffs, I live and breathe coding, making it an integral part of my life's journey. 💡

☕️ Starting my mornings with a steaming cup of coffee in one hand and a captivating book in the other, I eagerly explore the world of knowledge before diving into the realm of programming. 📚

🌙 But the excitement doesn't end there! By nightfall, I don my audio wizard cape, as I indulge in my exceptional talent for recording audiobooks. 🎙️ The combination of technology and storytelling creates a symphony of words that leaves listeners captivated. 🎧

Join me on my extraordinary adventure as I bring my coding expertise, insatiable thirst for knowledge, and enchanting voice to the thriving GitHub community! 💫

Feel free to connect and collaborate with me on GitHub

Happy coding and recording! 🚀🎉
